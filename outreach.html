                        <p>On the morning of January 16, 2025, we were presented an opportunity to collaborate with another FTC team, Team #25272 Bil Barbie. We arranged a meeting over zoom where we discussed our teams' histories and achievements.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Goals</h4>
                        <p>Through this zoom call, we aimed to learn more about other teams around the world and exchanging our experiences. We wanted to collaborate on initiatives to promote robotics in both our respective communities.</p>

                        <p>On January 16, 2025, some members in our team were given the honour of presenting about our robot during their presentation on simple machines. We used our robot as a demonstration of simple machines in action, such as lever action and axle rotations.</p>

                        <p>On December 10, 2024, we were invited by the STEMastery program at Delview Secondary for an outreach event. It was held afterschool, presented as an information session about what FTC is, as well as encouraging elementary students to join our team when they come to Delview!</p>
                        <p>We talked about our team's history and our progression throughout our years as a team. We explained the challenge presented to us in FTC and our strategy to combat it.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Goals</h4>
                        <p>During this event, our main goal was to inform the Gibson elementary students about the Robotic Raiders team and what FTC is all about. We aimed to demonstrate the robot's capabilities to the young students, and foster attention for potential future members to ensure the longevity of our team. Our presentation was a success as the younger students were captivated by the robot's controls and demonstrated an interest in joining the team in the future. Our goal of sharing the experience of robotics with the next generation was a success.</p>

                        <p>On February 18, 2023, our team was invited by Forces Unknown to attend an outreach event. The event was located at Wesbrooke Community Centre in Vancouver. At 10:00AM, we reached the centre and began helping Forces Unknown in setting up the playing field by arranging the mat and junctions.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Goals</h4>
                        <p>During this event, our main goal was to practice driving the robot and making improvements towards it. Based on the meeting we had before the outreach in the woodwork shop it was best to switch the controlling system to a two-control system since it would have helped us to stay more in control of the robot. After implementing this new system, lots of practice had to be done since the drivers had to be as proficient as possible with the new system. Another goal of this event was to answer as many questions as possible about the robot for adults and children. The best example we had for this outcome was when we explained to an inquisitive visitor how the robot's slide worked and how the rules of the game worked.</p>
